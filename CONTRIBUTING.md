# Contributing to Django Silque Notifications

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Django Silque Notifications as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev_fahad`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code follows the existing style (run `ruff check`)
5. Issue a pull request to the `dev_fahad` branch

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to your fork (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request to our `dev_fahad` branch

## Code Style

- Run `ruff check --fix .` before committing
- Run `ruff format .` to format code
